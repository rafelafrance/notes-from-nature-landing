## Adding an Expedition

1. __Obtain the following from Science Team:__

  1. Related Panoptes workflow ID and name from production project #1558
  2. Expedition "snippet", aka rollover text
  3. Image (reduce size, rename, as needed)
  4. Info icon link

2. __Update `notes-from-nature-landing` GitHub repo__

  1. Create new branch
  2. Add items from Step #1 to `src/constants/expeditions.js` (see other expeditions in file for reference)
  3. Add image to `src/images/expeditions/`

3. __Test locally__

  1. Create workflow in preview project #1613 (Notes from Nature on Staging) with same workflow name as step 1.i.
  2. Activate (if not already) just created preview test workflow via Project Builder, Visibility section
  3. Check for expedition on localhost
  4. Test expedition Info icon link

4. __Deploy to production__  
Note: recommend deploying to production from new branch, if problem can redeploy quickly from master, can add and merge new branch after successful deploy.

  2. Wait, deploy may take up to 15 minutes.

5. __Edit related workflow `image-layout` via API__

  2. workflowVariable.update({'configuration.image_layout':['no-max-height']})
  3. workflowVariable.save()

6. __Once deploy complete, activate workflow, push branch up to GitHub__
  1. Let Science Team member know they're clear to activate workflow, or activate yourself via Project Builder, Visibility section
  2. If you activate, or after Science Team member has, confirm expedition properly shows on notesfromnature.org
